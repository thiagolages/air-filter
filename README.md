# air-filter

Python code to be used in a Raspberry Pi to:

  - Check if an air filter inside a vehicle is punctured and is leaking air, which can radically decrease the motor lifespan.
  - Check if the air filter is extremely dirty (saturated) and thus, is making the vehicle consume more fuel.

Freelance project I made with a small company, by demand.
